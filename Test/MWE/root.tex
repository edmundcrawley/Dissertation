The first two columns of table \ref{table:Persistence} show that the degree of persistence in the original BPP model makes a big difference to the estimate of $\phi$, while all of the time aggregation models show similar estimates for $\psi$. This suggests the difference we see in the estimates of $\phi$ between BPP original model and the time aggregated model may be driven, at least in part, by misspecification in the model of transitive income shocks. It is reassuring that, in contrast to the BPP model, the values of both $\phi$ and $\psi$ are relatively robust to the exact specification of transitive persistence in the time aggregated model.
